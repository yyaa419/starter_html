            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his days
                lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make
                friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to
                give chase.</p>
            <p>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He
                would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.</p>

            <p>Brul is a 2yr old Maine coon cat. She prefers to spend his days lying in the bed. She enjoys watching
                outside from the window as long as there are no loud noises and bugs outside.
            </p>
            <p>Brul loves walks on the beach and taking sun naps on a warm summer day. Brul is a playful cat but enjoys
                having slow, relaxed days at the same time. She hates grooming and bathing.

            <img src="images/pet/rocket/rocket_primary.jpg" width="400" alt="Rockect: cute, small and yellow pomeranian 
            ">

            <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose.
                Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest.
                Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.
            </p>
            <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will 'say hi' to you after
                a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs are
                hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, donâ€™t hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy
                the whole day.
