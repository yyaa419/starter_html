            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and
                provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains
                about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors
                injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
                bad decisions by visiting <a

                the north is Phang-nga and the nearest provinces to the east are

                Chinese Vegetarian Festival is held there every year. While the Chinese

            <h3>Geographical Location: Europe</h3>
            <p> Paris lives up to its hype: A city with unbelievable food and culture, plus stunning views everywhere
                you turn. With 18 arrondissements, it's a lot to see in one trip, but each neighborhood has a
                personality all its own. You can't miss the iconic 7th, where art and history meet—there's the Eiffel
                Tower, sure, but the impressive Musée du quai Branly is just a short walk away. It houses an amazing
                collection of indigenous art. Or, hit up Montmartre (the 18th), with its boho shops and cozy brasseries.
                It's a must-stop on the way up or down from Sacre Coeur. While the French practically invented fine
                dining, don't skip the street food—Paris has world-class kebabs and falafel. But no matter where you
                are, be sure to pop into a sidewalk cafe, sip a glass of wine, and people watch—it's the way to get a
                taste of true Parisian culture.</p>
            <p>Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of
                the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide
                downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the
                boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey "Paris stone". They
                also built the major parks around the city centre. The high residential population of its city
                centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities. </p>
